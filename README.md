Electricity theft detection
-------------------------------------
**Features of the application** 
For the past few years we have been facing a great electricity crisis since the demand of electricity is more than the production. Hence it is very important to manage electricity efficiently. In this regard one of the major challenges in electricity management is misuse of the power consumption due to electricity theft in public area. In this paper we propose a technique that detects the electricity theft by remotely monitoring the electricity meter readings to see whether it is within the specified threshold value and thus minimizing the misuse of electric power consumption in public areas. It also aims in the reduction of manual workload by tracking the data automatically. The paper mainly focuses on the implementation of the concept using Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying framework to achieve real time monitoring through Raspberry pi board.

**Technologies Used**
1. Python
2. IoT
3. MQTT
