Electricity theft detection
-------------------------------------
**Features of the application** - For the past few years we have been facing a great electricity crisis since the demand of electricity is more than the production. Hence it is very important to manage electricity efficiently. In this regard one of the major challenges in electricity management is misuse of the power consumption due to electricity theft in public area. In this paper we propose a technique that detects the electricity theft by remotely monitoring the electricity meter readings to see whether it is within the specified threshold value and thus minimizing the misuse of electric power consumption in public areas. It also aims in the reduction of manual workload by tracking the data automatically. The paper mainly focuses on the implementation of the concept using Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying framework to achieve real time monitoring through Raspberry pi board.

**Technologies Used**
1. Python
2. IoT
3. MQTT

**Conclusion and Future Scope** - Our system can be used to monitor power consumption in  public  places  using  an  IoT  board  (raspberry  pi)  as  the underlying  framework  which  acts  as  an  interface  between  the energy meter and the remotely placed system.  Collection of data from the energy meter in the form of pulses and sent to GPIO pin of raspberry pi which is processed continuously by the system and the  processed  data  is  stored  in  the  database  for  the  later inspections. Calculation of threshold value based on test cases and if the meter reading value exceeds the threshold value it shows variation in graph and also sends notification to the concerned authority. This system also reduces lot of work load of power station officials. As  a  future  work,  following  features  can  be incorporated to the implemented system: 1. wireless connection could be established between the energy meter and Raspberry Pi. 2. A remote monitoring of the switch could be implemented so that  the  required  appliances  could  be  controlled  at  the  station when there is a threat of theft. 3. The system could be made still better by generating an automated electricity bill. 4. This system can also be made to promote a prepaid electricity system based on  the  continuous  power  monitoring.  5.  The  system  could  be made to work offline through some better implications.
